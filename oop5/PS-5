Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and
compute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes triangle and rectangle. Make
compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their
requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area.
Implement dynamic binding for given case study.
